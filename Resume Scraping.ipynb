Optimized the intermediate results and found the best gene set has around 20 genes, which matched quite well with the literatures. Discovered some weak points and enabled each predictive model to make better classification. --Created a new version of the SPC (i.e. supervised principal components). The predictive model obtained the best classification performance with a p value of 1.35e-06 among all models. --Verified that the semi-supervised algorithms overpowered the other two types of approaches and concluded strengths and weaknesses of each type of model. \n",

      " Risk Prediction of Collisions in Toronto (Major Research Project) Ryerson University, Data Science Lab | May 2017 - September 2017  From the time series analysis using ARIMA, a collision pattern for the historical data is observed and collision forecast is illustrated. Here, the accuracy of 85% is achieved for prediction of collisions, which is quite significant in this model. This result reflects the dependency of collision with the previous collision with the time value. Also from the second model based on decision tree and random forest, it is observed that the severity of injury is clearly explained by variables. Under this model, I am able to identify the key factors related to the severity of injury leading to the injury classes like fatal, major, minimal, minor and none.  Voluntary Retirement Prediction of Employees (Term Projects) Ryerson University, Data Science Lab | Jan 2017 - April 2017  Prediction of employee turnover in a company, which indicates how many employees are going to take voluntary retirement. Explored the dataset in different visualization to see the relationship of employee voluntary data with various attributes like Performance, Age, Gender. Used logistic regression model for prediction modeling. The model predicts the likelihood of categorical outcome whether the employee is 'staying' or 'leaving'.  Data Visualization of Baby Name  (Term Projects) Ryerson University, Data Science Lab | Jan 2017 - April 2017  Used tools ggplot2, R and D3 for Analytics and Data Visualization of baby name and birth in New York City, which describes the different visualization on the basis of baby name, county, and gender. Studied on explaining the most popular baby name, birth analysis based on year, county and gender on the different attributes. Studied the similarities and differences, concerning the naming tendency. Explored the naming analogies or differences between counties, in an easy and comprehensive way.  Social Media Topic Mining (Term Projects) Ryerson University, Data Science Lab | Jan 2017 - April 2017  Collected the data from twitter social media platform with the help of Twitter Search API and use R programming language for Analysis and visualization. The data mining and analysis was focused on customers talk about the brand, car insurance, customer satisfaction, competitors marketing strategies and issues related to these two companies. With the help of this social media mined data, companies are able to compare their brands with the other company's brands to increase the performance and hence increase their business. \n",
